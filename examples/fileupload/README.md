# File upload

This example contains a script that can be run as a CGI script. If an
HTTP get is used to access the script a web page is returned. The page
comprises a form that allows you to upload a file to the server. When
the form is POSTed the uploaded file is read and returned as the
response to the HTTP request and so displayed in the user's browser.
